Git is a version control system that is used for software development that helps you to keep track of versions of your program. To start using git you have to know only these two commands below. If you want to contribute to the package you need a few more, but it's not important right now :-)

To get the package for the first time on your
computer run::

  $ git clone git@github.com:mmagnus/rna-pdb-tools.git

and if you want to update the package later run::

  $ git pull

if you see something like this::

  $ git pull
  Already up-to-date.  

it means that your version of the package is up to date, congrats! :-)
